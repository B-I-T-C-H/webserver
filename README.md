# node-crud

This contains code from the tutorial from scotch.io [here](https://scotch.io/courses/create-a-crud-app-with-node-and-mongodb/).

Scotch.io makes you pay to see the videos after tutorial 11 but their download link works, so you'll have to download the videos instead of streaming them.

Just in case, I also downloaded all of the videos which you can see in our shared dropbox folder that Ritz made.

These tutorials are really <i>really</i> good...
